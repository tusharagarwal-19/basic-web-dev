        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of <a href="#ai">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a> that focuses on building systems that learn from data and improve with experience.
            This CBT will cover key topics such as <a href="#supervised">Supervised Learning</a>, <a href="#unsupervised">Unsupervised Learning</a>, and <a href="#deep">Deep Learning</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            ML is transforming industries by enabling machines to perform tasks such as language translation, image recognition, and predictive analytics. Its applications span across healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and more, making it one of the most sought-after technologies today.

        <h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider "smart."
            ML is one of the approaches used to achieve AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            AI leverages Machine Learning to power technologies like chatbots, recommendation systems, and advanced robotics. Its applications extend to areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and decision-making systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            By integrating ML with AI, we can develop systems capable of adapting to new challenges and improving over time, creating endless possibilities for innovation.

        <h2>Supervised Learning</h2>
        <p>
            Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data. Examples include 
            <strong>classification</strong> (e.g., spam detection) and <strong>regression</strong> (e.g., predicting housing prices).
        </p>
        <p>
            In supervised learning, the algorithm learns the relationship between input features and the target variable. Applications include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fraud Detection:</strong> Identifying fraudulent transactions based on historical data.</li>
                <li><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong> Converting spoken language into text.</li>
                <li><strong>Weather Forecasting:</strong> Predicting weather conditions using past data.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Diagnosis:</strong> Identifying diseases based on patient symptoms and medical history.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Supervised learning models are widely used due to their ability to achieve high accuracy when provided with sufficient labeled data.

    <section id="unsupervised">
        <h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>
        <p>
            Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The goal is to find patterns or structure in the data, such as through 
            <a href="#clustering">clustering</a> or dimensionality reduction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Key applications of unsupervised learning include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Customer Segmentation:</strong> Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in data.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Basket Analysis:</strong> Discovering relationships between items in transactional data.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Network Analysis:</strong> Understanding connections and relationships within networks.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Unsupervised learning is particularly useful in exploratory data analysis and in situations where obtaining labeled data is challenging.

        <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
        <p>
            Deep Learning is a specialized area of ML focused on neural networks with many layers, enabling tasks such as image recognition, 
            natural language processing, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deep learning has revolutionized industries by achieving human-like performance in complex tasks. Key examples include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles:</strong> Enabling cars to detect objects, predict movements, and navigate safely.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Diagnosing diseases from medical images like X-rays and MRIs.</li>
                <li><strong>Voice Assistants:</strong> Powering systems like Siri and Alexa to understand and respond to voice commands.</li>
                <li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> Generating realistic animations and improving content recommendations on platforms like Netflix.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Deep learning thrives on large datasets and high-performance computing, making it a key driver of innovation in areas like generative AI, reinforcement learning, and real-time decision-making.
